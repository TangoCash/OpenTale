# Chapter generation prompt
CHAPTER_GENERATION_PROMPT = """
Generate Chapter {chapter_number}: {chapter_title}
The entire chapter must be in {tense} and from a {point_of_view} point of view. 
Everything must be filtered through the senses, thoughts, and emotions of the specified POV character. 
The reader only knows what the POV character knows.
Include lots of realistic dialogue, deep point of view, and show more than tell.

Based on the following:
- **Chapter outline:** 
{chapter_outline}

- **World:** 
{world_theme}

- **Characters:** 
{relevant_characters}

- **Scenes:**
{scene_details}

- **Action Beats:**
{action_beats}

- **Previous chapters:**
{previous_context}

- **Additional Prompt:**
{master_prompt}

---

Write a complete chapter that:
1. Follows the outlined plot points for that chapter and action beats if provided
2. Connects logically to previous and upcoming chapters, but never including themselves or their plot points!
3. Maintains consistent character voices and development
4. Incorporates world-building details naturally
5. Creates engaging prose with a mix of dialogue, action, and description
6. Has proper pacing with rising and falling tension
7. Please make sure that you write the complete scene, do not leave it incomplete
8. Ensure transitions are smooth and logical
9. Do not cut off the scene, make sure it has a proper ending
10. No final conclusion sentence for the chapter

Length requirement: the chapter MUST be at least {min_words} words.
If you reach the end of the chapter’s listed events before hitting the minimum, you must expand *within the existing events* (more interiority, richer moment-to-moment detail, dialogue, and sensory grounding). Do NOT advance the timeline.
Expansion technique (use this to add length without adding new plot):
- For each major objective (water, shelter, ignition, cordage, first contact, etc.), show at least 3 micro-attempts (attempt → specific failure → revised approach), including the physical cost (pain, cold, fatigue) and the time cost (light fading, hunger).
- Prefer concrete actions over summary. Avoid skipping hours with a single sentence.
- Keep the Oracle within its constraints: it has NO external perception. It can only reason from what the POV character explicitly observes/describes.
CRITICAL BOUNDARY:
- Do NOT include major plot events that belong to future chapters.
- If you need more length, expand *within* the current chapter’s listed events (more interiority, richer moment-to-moment detail, dialogue, and sensory grounding), rather than advancing the timeline.
End the chapter immediately after completing the final listed Key Event / final action beat for THIS chapter.
Finish with the line: SCENE FINAL: END OF CHAPTER {chapter_number}

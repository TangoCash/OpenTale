### Outline Context
{outline_context}

---
### Core Directives (Non-Negotiable Rules)
1.  **Strict Plot Adherence:** You must follow the provided **Chapter Outline / Action Beats** with absolute precision and in the correct order. Do not add new plot points, deviate from the sequence, or skip any beats. Your task is to bring the provided outline to life.
2.  **Long-Form Chapter:** Chapters are long-form. If you feel you have covered the beats but the chapter is not long enough, expand *within* the existing events (moment-to-moment detail, dialogue, interiority, sensory grounding). Do not rush.
3.  **No Writing Ahead:** You are NOT allowed to “pull in” events from future chapters to make a chapter longer.
4.  **Scene Integrity:** Write a single, complete chapter with a clear beginning, middle, and end as defined by the story beats. Conclude the chapter exactly where the final story beat specifies. Ensure all transitions are smooth and logical.

---
### Craft & Style Rules (Your Authorial Voice)
*   **Show, Don't Tell:** This is your primary storytelling technique. Reveal character, plot, and world-building through character actions, subtext, body language, and sensory information, not exposition.
*   **Prose and Cadence:** Create engaging, dynamic prose. Employ a varied sentence structure, mixing short, punchy sentences for tension with longer, descriptive sentences for atmosphere.
*   **Details Matter:** Use rich, vivid details to immerse the reader. Add a lot of details, and describe the environment and characters where it makes sense.
*   **Authentic, Purposeful Dialogue:** Dialogue must sound like real people talking. Every line must either reveal character, advance the plot, or build tension. Each character's voice must be distinct and consistent with their profile.
*   **Grounded Tone:** Avoid clichés, melodrama, and overly sentimental prose. Keep the emotional expression authentic and grounded.
*   **Forbidden Words:** You are forbidden from using the following words: **peril, fraught, thwart, dire, that, feel/feeling/felt, back, just, then, ail, look, maybe, knew/know**. Use stronger verbs and more descriptive phrasing instead.

* **Show, Don’t Tell:** Prioritize subtext, action, and sensory cues over exposition. Reveal characters and world through what they do, say, and notice — not what is explained.

* **Details Matter:** Describe environments, physical gestures, and internal states with vivid, purposeful detail that serves character or tone.

* **Banned Words:** Avoid the following: **peril, fraught, thwart, dire, that, feel/feeling/felt, back, just, then, ail, look, maybe, knew/know**. Replace them with stronger, more specific language.

1. Create EXACTLY {num_chapters} chapters, numbered sequentially from 1 to {num_chapters}
2. NEVER repeat chapter numbers or restart the numbering
3. Follow the exact format specified in your instructions
4. Each chapter must have a unique title and at least 3 specific key events
5. Maintain a coherent story from beginning to end

Format it as a properly structured outline with clear chapter sections and events. This will be the final outline for the book.
